# 09-weekly-meal-planner

## Description

This repo contains all files related to the meal planner project created by NCS Coding.

We were motivated to build the meal planner app to enable people to search for recipes based on requirements they can define. The app is inclusive to those with allergies or following restricted diets as it allows people to exclude specific ingredients.

This app is needed since people get bored of cooking the same meals and need recipe inspiration. In addition, this app solves the challenge of finding safe recipes for people following restricted diets.

We set up API calls to Spoonacular and Giphy to retrieve the data we needed.

This project enabled us to put into practice: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, GitHub and Figma. In particular it exposed us to the GitHub Pull Request workflow and enabled us to learn to create new branches, and submit and approve pull requests.

We also learnt how to write user stories and use them to implement new features to the website.

Within JavaScript, we learnt how to implement new functionality including: dropdown and checkbox user inputs, pagination, modal windows, and setting up favourites.

The app is mobile responsive.

## Usage

The meal planner allows users to plan their weekly meals based on dietary requirements. Users have the option of excluding ingredients, and can filter on cuisine, or specific diet through dropdowns. Users can also restrict recipe results by entering the time they're willing to spend preparing the recipe.

This app would be useful for anyone looking for inspiration when planning their weekly meals. It also serves people with restricted diets e.g. people with allergies or vegans. This app would also be useful to anyone cooking meals on a budget, or calorie counting.

On arrival to the homepage, users are presented with a food related giphy (selected at random from a preselected array). This makes the page look more interesting, and encourages people to think about food. We also branded our website with red and yellow colours as user research indicates that these colours remind people of food.

After hitting search, users are presented with a set of four recipe cards and can paginate through all available recipe results. The cards display: a recipe image, recipe name, price per serving in Â£, time to prepare in minutes, calories, a link to cooking instructions (which open in a modal window), a favourite button which can be toggled, and the recipe position within total results.

Users can also store favourite recipes for future reference. A list of favourite recipes can be accessed on the favourites page. Users can also remove recipes from here if they wish to.

There is also an about meal planner page which explains how the website works.

We created wireframes for the homepage and favourites page to guide their development.

The screenshot of the kanban board below in Trello demonstrates how we divided to project into tasks based on user stories and allocated them accordingly using agile methodology.
